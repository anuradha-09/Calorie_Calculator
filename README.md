# 🍎 Calorie Calculator

The **Calorie Calculator** is a simple web application that helps users estimate their daily calorie requirements based on age, gender, weight, height, and activity level.
The project demonstrates fundamental concepts of full-stack development, including user input handling, calculations, and clean UI design.

This application was developed as part of an academic project and showcases both frontend design and backend logic in a clean, modular structure.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The calculator uses the **Mifflin-St Jeor equation**, one of the most accurate methods for estimating basal metabolic rate (BMR).

### **Formula (Male):**

```
BMR = 10 * weight + 6.25 * height - 5 * age + 5
```

### **Formula (Female):**

```
BMR = 10 * weight + 6.25 * height - 5 * age - 161
```

### **TDEE Calculation:**

```
TDEE = BMR * Activity Factor
```

## 🔍 How It Works

1. User enters:

   * Age
   * Gender
   * Height
   * Weight
   * Activity level

2. The application:

   * Computes BMR
   * Multiplies by activity factor
   * Displays results

3. User receives:

   * Calories to maintain weight
